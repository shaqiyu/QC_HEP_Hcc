All the plotting functions are in modules/Plotter.py. Other functions that handel the data are in modules/Utilities.py.
If you have all the packages installed then the code should run directly out of the box. You just make sure to be in the main directory:
bin  config  logs  modules  plots  README.md  samples

To run the code use:

python3 bin/classificationqqyy.py
